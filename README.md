# ðŸ’” Listen to Your Heart: A Failure Detection ðŸ”®

## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, claiming around 17.9 million lives each year. This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a dataset that includes 11 relevant features.

## Objectives ðŸ“Œ

- Explore the dataset using visualizations.
- Preprocess and analyze the data.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for heart disease prediction.

## Dataset Description ðŸ§¾

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Age:** Patient's age (in years)
- **Sex:** Gender (0 = male, 1 = female)
- **Chest Pain Type:** Categorial (0 to 3)
- **Resting Blood Pressure:** (in mm Hg)
- **Serum Cholesterol:** (in mg/dl)
- **Fasting Blood Sugar:** (0 or 1)
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results:** (0 to 2)
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved:** 
- **Exercise Angina:** (0 or 1)
- **ST Depression Induced by Exercise:**
- **Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment:** (0 to 2)
- **Diabetes:** (0 or 1)
- **Smoking:** (0 or 1)
- **Creatine Values:** (0 to 2500)
- **Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy:** (0 to 3)
- **Thalassemia:** 
- **Heart Failed:** (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
